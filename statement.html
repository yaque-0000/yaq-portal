        <!-- Preface (for context/not the content of the artist statement) -->
<!-- I think along with the images and things I make it is important to note that in everyday conversations I communicate w/ a considerable amount of jargon (almost a dialect). I have created/accumulated words over the past few years, and I use them when speaking w/friends. I am unsure as to why I do this. My friends and I speak this dialect fluently, and if we were heard in the middle of a conversation I am quite sure that most people would not understand what we’re saying. When Juliet asked me why I did this i said “it’s probably a defence mechanism” 	 -->

        I think i make things to make sense of my weird experiences/phenomena that I would have difficulty explaining to someone with words. some of these weird experiences include:

        <p>
            This is a bad way of explaining it/this is what i mean by 'field compression':
            <br>

The sentence “I ate a delicious apple.” is a compressed version of “The apple’s skin was crispy. When I bit into it’s flesh, the juice molecules sent sweet signals to my brain. From what I can tell, this taste was pleseant.”
<br>
<br>
You say “i ate a delicious apple” instead of the latter because it would be ineffective to describe every aspect of  eating a delicious apple.
<br>
<br>
*I am not effective at compressing my thoughts and experiences into words,,, This is why I need to compress them with images, sounds and films.*

            <!-- Even w/ my art I fail to say something specific. My art does not attempt to comment on issues of the world, or describe a universal feeling. I fail to compress with words, and when I compress with images the product is incoherent. #lawl #unfortunate i think Syntax Error exemplifies this -->

            Re: Syntax Error Magazine <br>

syntax error is called syntax error because sometimes I speak as if i have not learned syntax,
the images in syntax error are usually images of bad graphic design, packaging and kitschy things 
<br>
this is all i currently have to say ab my Makes
