Different Tiers of Imagery<br><br>

First-hand: anything derived from the natural world, anything that is not man made<br><br>
ex: tree, waterfall

Second hand: something designed for functionality - not with the intention of it being art, emphasis is less on aesthetics, beauty, commentary, or an attempt to convey experience (not saying that functional items are not art)
ex: fork, garbage can, cup<br><br>

Third-hand: something that is designed with obvious consideration of aesthetics, visual purpose, implicit attempts at evoking emotion, e.g specific usage of colour, texture, imagery derived from first and secondhand images
ex: advertisements, logos, <br><br>

Fourth-hand:
other peopleâ€™s art
ex: painting, sculpture<br><br>

Shitting system:<br><br>

imagery and experiences that are significant enough for you to have remembered it n to have made a resulting image that references it or directly attempts to depict/mimic it<br><br>

unaltered shits (the ideal) are the result of a desperate need to take a shit (need to render images and experiences)<br><br>

most shits are altered by shit-templates - restrictions that are either implemented subconsciously or have become integral parts of your art making process either due to their apparent appeal (work that u desperately want to make) or having learned it <br><br>

shit templates:<br><br>
- being overly concerned with composition<br><br>
